General Overview
The game is to quiz learners on their knowledge on material covered in the etextbook
we are using for this course.
Target System and Requirements

The game should provide a mechanism for users to choose if the quiz will be on the
entire text, a particular unit, or a particular chapter, and then the questions will be
read into the game program accordingly.


The multiple-choice question presented to the user each time should be randomly
selected from the list imported from the text file or files.

The game will show the points the user scored dynamically in the form of ratio.

The game should begin with a welcome/introduction page that tells what the game is
and how the user should play, and then should advance to the quiz after a delay or a
key-press.

Use graphics, colours, background music, and sound effects to make the game
interesting and user-friendly.
