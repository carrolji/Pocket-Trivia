1. Which of the following is not one of the three deterministic algorithms 
covered in this chapter?
A.	Random logic B. Tracking C. Conditions D. Patterns
2. Can fuzzy matrices be used without multiplying the input memberships? 
Why or why not?
A.	No, it is absolutely necessary to multiply the input memberships. 
B.	Yes, but only after negating the matrix.
